                    My name is Mitchell Pullin, I am a Full-Stack web developer leveraging restaurant background to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. 
                    Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from the University of Central Florida Coding Bootcamp, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. 
                    Known as a problem solver and hard worker, passionate about developing apps, and moving into a new field. With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user experience. 
                    I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a recent project. I worked on a team of three to develop a single-page MERN app resembling a satirical myspace/facebook styling to allow people who believe in flat-earth to befriend one another. 
                    Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web.
